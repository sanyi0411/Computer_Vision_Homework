# Computer Vision Homework (Gépi látás beadandó)
### 2019-2020/Autumn semester

### Hi,
As of writing this, I am a sophomore `Computer Engineering` student at [Széchenyi István University](https://uni.sze.hu/kezdolap) (Győr, Hungary). I took a course called `Computer Vision` and this is my homework for it, I had to create by myself.

### The task
My task was to create a program using OpenCV 4, that can detect speed limit signs on pictures and read and return the values written on them. Below you can find manual on how to use the program. </br>
