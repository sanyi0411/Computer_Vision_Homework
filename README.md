# Computer Vision Homework (Gépi látás beadandó)
### 2019-2020/Autumn semester

## Hi,
As of writing this, I am a sophomore `Computer Engineering` student at [Széchenyi István University](https://uni.sze.hu/kezdolap) (Győr, Hungary). I took a course called `Computer Vision` and this is my homework for it, I had to create by myself.

## The task
My task was to create a program using OpenCV 4. I could choose any project, using any language I was willing to. OpenCV has libraries for python as well but I'm more familiar with C++ so that's what I choose.</br>
It still sounds like somewhat a science fiction to me that cars can "see" speed limit signs or other road signs and behave according to them. For example change their speed or lights, prepare the brakes etc. But it's not. For many years now, high-end cars have the capability to detect these road signs via their built in cameras at the front windshield change the setting of the cruise control or even break. I set out to replicate a part of this system, specifically the speed limit sign recognition.</br>
I was instructed to use still images rather than a video feed from a camera, so that's what I did.</br>
It was a good challange but also a great fun to figure out how to make it work and how to set up the many variables to get the best result. As I figured there are many ways of doing this, this is only one of them. Others might have done better but this is what I could make work and I only had limited time.</br>
Below you can find more information on how to compile the program from source, how to use and how it's working. I know it's not working with 100% accuracy, I only had so much time I knowledge. In the future I am willing to try different methods to make it work better.</br>
