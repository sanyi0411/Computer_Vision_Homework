- Open the *SpeedSignRecognitionSolution.sln* file with Visual Studio
- Press *Ctrl + Shift + B* to build the solution
- This will generate an *.exe* file
- If you don't want to always run this exe from command line, you can supply arguments from Visual Studio, just like if you were from command line. Check out [this](https://dailydotnettips.com/how-to-pass-command-line-arguments-using-visual-studio/) site
